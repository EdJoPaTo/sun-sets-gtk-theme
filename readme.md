# Sun sets GTK theme

Set GTK Theme based on the sun position


This was a bodge I used when Gnome 40 was released and forced all extensions to update their GUIs to GTK4 (which broke existing GTK3 ones).
I was asked about it so I set this repo to public.
It was never intended to be used but it might work out for you.
Good luck!

# Alternatives

Normally I use the Gnome extension [Night Theme Switcher](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2236/night-theme-switcher/) which is also available in the ([AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gnome-shell-extension-nightthemeswitcher-git)).
It works with Gnome 40 now.
